MeeGo's ShareUI is available on Nokia's Harmattan platform and this will be an example of how to use it.

The sharing feature looks like

It is akin to Intents in the Android universe in that new applications can register themselves to handle share requests.

So far I am totally stuck on linking MeeGo's ShareUI from a Harmattan Qt/QML project.
